 # <h2> Description </h2>
Kowope Mart is a Nigerian-based retail company with a vision to provide quality goods, education and automobile services to its customers at affordable price and reduce if not eradicate charges on card payments and increase customer satisfaction with credit rewards that can be used within the Mall. To achieve this, the company has partnered with DSBank on co-branded credit card with additional functionality such that customers can request for loan, pay for goods even with zero-balance and then pay back within an agreed period of time. This innovative strategy has increased sales for the company. However, there has been recent cases of credit defaults and Kowope Mart will like to have a system that profiles customers who are worthy of the card with minimum if not zero risk of defaulting.

You have been employed as a Data Scientist to leverage Machine learning to predict customers who are likely to default or not.

# <h3> dataset </h3>
The data is a structure dataset pull from the Kowope Martâ€™s database with few important features that can be used to predict defaulters in retail network. The data sample has been split into train and test with a volume of 56,000 and 24,000.

The files for download are:
* train.csv - you will use this to train your model.
* test.csv - you will use this to test your model.
* SampleSubmission.csv - is an example of what your submission file should look like. The order of the rows does not matter, but the names of the UIDs must be correct. You must predict growth_stage for the corresponding images.

dataset used for training and testing this model can be downloadeded [here](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/dsn-ai-bootcamp-qualification-hackathon/data)on Zindi.
